These are instructions to build iaxclient with Microsoft Visual Studio
2005. The solution file and project files are located in the
contrib/win/vs2005 directory.

 1) The following environment variables must be set. Use the "System"
    properties dialog in the Windows Control Panel to set these
    variables either for the user or system-wide.

    %DXSDK_DIR%

    Path to the DirectX SDK. The December 2006 version of the DirectX
    SDK has been known to work.

    %PSDK_DIR%
    
    Path to the Platform SDK. The Platform SDK for Windows Server
    2003 Release 2 has been known to work.

 2) Open the solution file: contrib/win/vs2005/iaxclient.sln

 3) Build the solution. This will build the several libraries (.lib
    files) that must be linked with the end application:

      Release\libgsm\libgsm.lib
      Release\libiax2\libiax2.lib
      Release\libiaxclient\libiaxclient.lib
      Release\libportaudio\libportaudio.lib
      Release\libportmixer\libportmixer.lib
      Release\libvideolib\libvideolib.lib

 4) In addition to the above libraries that are built as part of the
    iaxclient build, there are several other third-party library
    dependencies that must be met:

      speex
      libtheora
      libogg

    These standard Windows-provided libraries must also be linked in:

      strmiids.lib
      Wininet.lib
      comsuppw.lib
